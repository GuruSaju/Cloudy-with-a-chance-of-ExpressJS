# Node-JS
Repo for my Node js projects

Node.js is an open source server framework which basically uses JS on the server (how cool is that)
Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.

Please don't confuse asynchronous with threading. Both are totally different.

So if we have Node JS then we don't need a backend language like Java or everything can be done by Node Js?
I am gonna say no. Node JS is best used for light weight computations. Because of its non-blocking nature. 
Since it relies heavily on callbacks heavy computations might lead long queues of callback funtions to execute on a single thread. 
So it is not recommended. 

More to be continued.....
