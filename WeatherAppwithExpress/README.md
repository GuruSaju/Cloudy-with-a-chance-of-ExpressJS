Simple weather app  
What I used  
Node.js  
Express.js command : npm install --save express  
EJS (embedded javascript)  
  
To use EJS in Express setup template engine
"A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page."

or in simpler words we can use variables and dynamically use those to create our HTML file to send it to the browser

command :npm install ejs --save  
EJS is accessed by default in the views directory
